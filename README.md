## 🧠 How the Game Works (Technical Overview)

### 🎯 **Movement**
Using functions like:

```cpp
gotoxy(x, y);

to place the player's car and obstacle cars in the console window.

🎯 Obstacle Generation

Random positions:
int obstacleX = rand() % laneWidth;

🎯 Speed Increase

After scoring 20:
if(score >= 20) speed = speed - 10;

🎯 Collision Check
